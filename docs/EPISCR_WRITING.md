# Topic: EPISCR Writing Framework

> **Pronunciation**: EPISCR = "eh-PIS-kur" (rhymes with "whisker")
>
> **One-line Definition**: A "gentle transformation" writing framework centered on Insight + Reflection

---

## Quick Start (EPISCR Lite)

**Understand EPISCR in 3 minutes**

### Six-Stage Overview

| Stage | Name | One-liner | Target % |
|:-----:|:-----|:---------|:--------:|
| **E** | Emotion | Paint feelings through concrete scenes | 10-15% |
| **P** | Problem | Articulate the struggle in relatable terms | 15-20% |
| **I** | Insight | Deliver a perspective-shifting reframe | 20-25% |
| **S** | Solution | Propose small, actionable steps for today | 20-25% |
| **C** | Close | Return to opening, show transformation | 10-15% |
| **R** | Reflection | Hand the baton to the reader with questions | 5-10% |

### Core Rules

1. **One article = one insight** — Depth beats breadth
2. **"We" over "You"** — Solidarity, not lecturing
3. **Micro-actions only** — Achievable in under 2 minutes

### Minimal Template

```
[E] A specific scene (1-3 lines)
[P] The shared struggle beneath it (2-4 lines)
[I] The reframe: "It's not X, it's actually Y" (2-5 lines)
[S] A small action doable today (1-3 lines)
[C] Callback to opening, showing change (1-3 lines)
[R] A question for the reader (1 line)
```

## Agent Contract

- **PURPOSE**:
  - Define a structured approach for writing emotionally resonant content optimized for blogs, essays, SNS, and personal media
  - Enable AI agents to produce empathetic, insight-driven narratives that move readers toward understanding and action
  - Standardize the psychological journey from emotional hook to reflective closure
- **USE_WHEN**:
  - Writing personal essays, blog posts, or long-form SNS content (note, Medium, Substack)
  - Creating content addressing emotional topics (loneliness, self-doubt, burnout, relationships, identity)
  - Producing pieces where reader empathy and "feeling understood" are primary goals
  - Building narrative arcs that balance vulnerability with actionable insight
- **DO_NOT_USE_WHEN**:
  - Writing pure how-to articles, technical documentation, or manuals (use PREP or PISD instead)
  - Creating sales letters or landing pages (use AIDA or PAS instead)
  - Producing long-form fiction requiring complex plot structures (use Hero's Journey or Three-Act Structure)
  - Drafting academic papers or formal reports requiring objective, impersonal tone
- **PRIORITY**:
  - For emotional/personal content, EPISCR takes precedence over generic blog templates
  - When combined with persuasion techniques, EPISCR provides the emotional foundation while AIDA/PAS principles can inform specific sections
  - Defer to platform-specific guidelines for format constraints (character limits, heading requirements)
- **RELATED_TOPICS**:
  - narrative-transportation
  - expressive-writing
  - behavior-change-frameworks
  - copywriting-formulas

---

## TL;DR

- **WHAT**: A six-stage writing framework (Emotion → Problem → Insight → Solution → Close → Reflection) designed for emotionally resonant content in blogs, essays, and social media
- **WHY**: Guides readers through a psychological journey that creates empathy, delivers understanding, and motivates gentle action—addressing the gap between generic advice content and truly transformative writing
- **WHEN**: Personal essays, vulnerable posts about struggles/growth, advice pieces requiring emotional buy-in, long-form SNS content on note/Medium/Substack
- **HOW**: Open with visceral emotion, articulate the shared problem, deliver a reframing insight, offer small actionable steps, close the narrative arc, then hand the baton to the reader with reflective questions
- **WATCH_OUT**: Avoid lecturing tone in Problem section; keep Solutions concrete and achievable; never use accusatory questions in Reflection

## Canonical Definitions

### EPISCR

**Definition**: A six-stage writing framework optimized for emotional and personal media that guides readers through a complete psychological arc from connection to reflection.

**Full Name Expansion**:

| Letter | Stage | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **E** | Emotion | Visceral opening hook using concrete imagery |
| **P** | Problem | Clear articulation of shared struggle |
| **I** | Insight | Reframing perspective or structural understanding |
| **S** | Solution | Small, achievable action steps |
| **C** | Close | Narrative resolution with emotional landing |
| **R** | Reflection | Open questions returning agency to reader |

**Scope**:
- **Includes**: The six stages defined in "Full Name Expansion" above, executed in sequence E→P→I→S→C→R
- **Excludes**:
  - Technical specifications or procedural instructions
  - Hard-sell persuasion or conversion-focused copy
  - Plot-driven fiction with multiple characters and subplots
  - Academic argumentation requiring citations and counterarguments

**Related Concepts**:
- **Similar**: PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve), AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action), narrative arc structures
- **Contrast**: PREP (Point-Reason-Example-Point) for logic-first content; Hero's Journey for long-form fiction
- **Contains**: Narrative transportation elements (see "Visceral Emotion Opening" pattern), behavior change triggers (see "Micro-Action Solutions" pattern), expressive writing principles (see "Reframing Insight Delivery" pattern)

**Example**:

```text
[E] 2 AM, phone in hand, unable to think of anyone to message.
[P] The cruelest part of loneliness is the whisper: "No one needs you."
[I] But feeling lonely might actually be a healthy signal—your need for connection is working.
[S] Create one small connection per day: thank a cashier with eye contact, leave a kind comment.
[C] The world's edges came back into focus. Not perfect, but I learned to create "not alone" moments myself.
[R] What small connection could you create today?
```

**Sources**: [R1], [R2], [R3]

### Narrative Transportation

**Definition**: A psychological state where readers become absorbed in a story world, with their mental processing focused on the narrative's events, resulting in attitude and belief changes that persist beyond the reading experience.

**Scope**:
- **Includes**:
  - Immersive attention on story elements
  - Emotional engagement with narrative events
  - Reduced critical evaluation of message content
  - Post-narrative attitude shifts
- **Excludes**:
  - Passive information consumption
  - Analytical reading for fact extraction
  - Detached evaluation of logical arguments

**Related Concepts**:
- **Similar**: Flow state, absorption, imaginative involvement
- **Contrast**: Central-route persuasion (logic-based), peripheral-route persuasion (heuristic-based)
- **Contains**: Emotional identification, mental imagery, temporal displacement

**Example**:

```text
When a reader encounters "I couldn't sleep, staring at the ceiling at 3 AM
wondering if anyone would notice if I disappeared"—they don't analyze
the statement. They *feel* it. This is transportation: the critical
faculty suspends as the reader enters the narrator's experience.
```

**Sources**: [R1]

### Reader Psychological Journey

**Definition**: The intended emotional and cognitive progression that EPISCR orchestrates, moving readers from connection through understanding to self-directed reflection.

**Scope**:
- **Includes**:
  1. Emotional hook → "This might be about me"
  2. Problem recognition → "That's exactly what I feel"
  3. Insight reception → "I never thought of it that way"
  4. Solution visualization → "I could actually do that"
  5. Narrative closure → "This feels complete and hopeful"
  6. Personal reflection → "What does this mean for my life?"
- **Excludes**:
  - Passive entertainment without personal relevance
  - Information transfer without emotional engagement
  - Persuasion without reader agency

**Related Concepts**:
- **Similar**: Customer journey (marketing), learning progression (education)
- **Contrast**: Information dump, lecture format, pure storytelling
- **Contains**: Empathy triggers, cognitive reframes, behavioral prompts

**Sources**: [R3], [R4], [R5]

## Section Length Guidelines

Recommended proportions for a standard EPISCR article:

| Section | % of Total | Word Count (1500w article) | Purpose |
|---------|------------|---------------------------|---------|
| **E** (Emotion) | 10-15% | 150-225 words | Hook quickly, don't overstay |
| **P** (Problem) | 15-20% | 225-300 words | Build recognition, not exhaustion |
| **I** (Insight) | 20-25% | 300-375 words | The core value—give it room |
| **S** (Solution) | 20-25% | 300-375 words | Concrete enough to act on |
| **C** (Close) | 10-15% | 150-225 words | Land cleanly, don't drag |
| **R** (Reflection) | 5-10% | 75-150 words | Brief—reader takes over |

**Notes**:
- These are guidelines, not rules. Some pieces will naturally weight differently.
- Short-form content (tweets, short posts) compresses all sections but maintains the sequence.
- If Emotion exceeds 20%, you may be delaying the point. If Insight is under 15%, the piece may lack depth.

## Core Patterns

### Pattern: Visceral Emotion Opening

**Intent**: Capture reader attention within the first 1-5 lines by creating immediate emotional resonance through concrete, sensory details rather than abstract statements.

**Context**: Opening any EPISCR piece where the goal is to make readers feel "this is about me" before they consciously decide to continue reading.

**Implementation**:

```markdown
## ❌ Abstract Opening (Weak)
Modern life is filled with anxiety and disconnection. Many people
struggle with feeling alone in a crowded world.

## ✅ Visceral Opening (Strong)
The notification sound made my heart jump—then nothing. Another
promotional email. I put the phone face-down on the table, but my
hand stayed close, waiting for a message that wouldn't come.
```

**Key Principles**:
- **Concrete over abstract**: Show a specific moment, not a general truth
- **First-person singular default**: Prefer "I" unless voice spec requires otherwise; third-person weakens transportation
- **Sensory anchoring**: Include what can be seen, heard, or physically felt
- **Emotional authenticity**: Raw feelings (loneliness, confusion, fear) without polish
- **Brevity**: 1-5 lines maximum; density matters more than length

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Advantages**: Immediate engagement, emotional buy-in, narrative transportation activation
- ⚠️ **Disadvantages**: Requires vulnerability; may not suit all writer personas; harder to generate than generic openings
- 💡 **Alternatives**: Question-based hooks, surprising statistics (less emotional but can work for certain topics)

**Sources**: [R1], [R6], [R9]

---

### Pattern: Problem Articulation Without Lecturing

**Intent**: Name the reader's pain in words they recognize but couldn't articulate themselves, while maintaining solidarity rather than creating distance through judgment.

**Context**: The P (Problem) section, after emotional connection is established, where the goal is to make the struggle explicit and shared.

**Implementation**:

```markdown
## ❌ Lecturing Tone (Alienating)
The problem is that you haven't developed proper social skills. You
need to work on your communication abilities and stop avoiding
social situations.

## ✅ Solidarity Tone (Connecting)
Here's the thing about loneliness that makes it especially cruel:
it comes with a voice that whispers "you're the only one." We start
believing we're uniquely broken, that everyone else has figured out
this connection thing except us. I believed that for years.
```

**Key Principles**:
- **"We" over "You"**: Include yourself in the struggle
- **Validate before explaining**: Acknowledge the pain is real
- **Specificity**: Describe the exact texture of the problem (the 3 AM thoughts, the fake smile)
- **Structural framing**: Hint that the problem has causes beyond personal failure
- **No diagnosis**: Describe symptoms, don't label the person

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Advantages**: Builds trust, maintains engagement, sets up Insight section
- ⚠️ **Disadvantages**: Can feel indulgent if too long; requires careful tone calibration
- 💡 **Alternatives**: Use reader's own words (from comments, surveys) for maximum recognition

**Sources**: [R1], [R2], [R10]

---

### Pattern: Reframing Insight Delivery

**Intent**: Shift the reader's understanding of their problem from personal failure to structural/psychological pattern, creating an "aha moment" that opens space for change.

**Context**: The I (Insight) section, the pivotal turn where readers move from feeling stuck to seeing possibility.

**Implementation**:

```markdown
## Structure: "It's not X, it's actually Y"

## Example: Loneliness
What I eventually realized: loneliness isn't a sign that something
is wrong with you. It's a signal that something is *right*—your
need for connection is working exactly as designed. Loneliness is
the hunger that tells you to seek nourishment, not evidence that
you're unworthy of food.

## Example: Procrastination
For years I thought I was lazy. Then I learned: procrastination
isn't about willpower. It's an emotional regulation problem. We
avoid tasks that trigger anxiety, boredom, or fear of failure.
The issue isn't that we can't work—it's that we're protecting
ourselves from uncomfortable feelings.
```

**Key Principles**:
- **Cognitive reframe**: Shift from shame to understanding
- **Structural explanation**: Show the "why" behind the struggle
- **External attribution**: Move blame from character to circumstance/design
- **One article = one core reframe**: Resist the urge to include multiple insights; depth beats breadth
- **Metaphor usage**: Abstract insights land better with concrete comparisons

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Advantages**: Creates lasting perspective shift, reduces shame, enables action
- ⚠️ **Disadvantages**: Risks oversimplification; must be genuinely novel to reader
- 💡 **Alternatives**: Research citation for credibility, personal discovery narrative for authenticity

**Sources**: [R1], [R4], [R5], [R10]

### Insight Discovery Methods

> **Note**: Insight (I) is the heart of EPISCR and the hardest part to write. Use these methods to excavate your "aha moment."

#### Method 1: 5 Whys

Drill down five levels of "why?" on an emotional theme.

```
Theme: Procrastination
Why 1: Why do I procrastinate? → I'm scared to start
Why 2: Why am I scared to start? → I might fail
Why 3: Why does failure scare me? → It proves I'm not good enough
Why 4: Why does that matter? → My self-worth feels threatened
Why 5: Why is my self-worth tied to this? → I measure myself by outcomes

→ Insight: Procrastination isn't laziness—it's a defense mechanism protecting self-worth
```

#### Method 2: Polarity Flip

Ask: "What if this 'bad' thing is actually functional or a signal?"

```
Default view: Loneliness = lack of social skills, a problem
Flipped: Loneliness = a healthy signal that your need for connection is working

Default view: Perfectionism = having high standards
Flipped: Perfectionism = fear-based defense mechanism

Default view: Anger = negative emotion to control
Flipped: Anger = alarm that a boundary has been crossed
```

#### Method 3: Systemic Zoom-Out

Ask: "What if this isn't a personal flaw but a structural/environmental issue?"

```
Personal level: "Why can't I make friends?"
Structural level: "Adults lack 'repeated unplanned interactions.'
                  In school, you were trapped in the same room daily—
                  friendships happened automatically.
                  Adults must intentionally recreate those conditions."

Personal level: "Why can't I focus?"
Structural level: "Modern environments are designed to capture attention.
                  Inability to focus isn't weak willpower—
                  it's a mismatch with the environment."
```

#### Method 4: Reader Voice Mining

Extract insight seeds from comments, DMs, and reviews where readers are trying to articulate something.

```
Comment patterns to watch:
- "I get it, but something feels different for me..."
- "In my case, it was actually..."
- "So basically what you're saying is...?"

→ Readers unconsciously articulate the insight you should make explicit
```

#### Insight Strength Levels

| Level | Type | Example | Effect |
|:-----:|:-----|:--------|:-------|
| Lv1 | Perspective Shift | Loneliness isn't "failure"—it's a "signal" | Provides awareness |
| Lv2 | Paradigm Shift | Perfectionism = not "high standards" but "fear-based defense" | Changes understanding |
| Lv3 | Identity Shift | See yourself as "someone who writes" not "a writer" | Changes self-concept |

> **Principle**: One article = one insight. However, for multi-layered themes, **up to two insights** may be acceptable (e.g., Lv1 opens the door, Lv2 deepens it).

---

### Pattern: Micro-Action Solutions

**Intent**: Translate insights into immediately actionable behaviors with minimal friction, addressing both motivation and ability barriers.

**Context**: The S (Solution) section, where understanding must become doing, but overwhelm would kill momentum.

**Implementation**:

```markdown
## Solution Design Framework (Based on Fogg Behavior Model)

### Components:
1. **Motivation**: Already built through E, P, I sections
2. **Ability**: Make the action tiny (under 2 minutes, no resources needed)
3. **Prompt**: Anchor to existing routine or specific trigger

## ❌ Vague Solution (Unusable)
Try to be more social and put yourself out there. You need to
build deeper connections with people.

## ✅ Micro-Action Solution (Usable)
Here's what worked for me—one tiny change:
- **The action**: When I buy coffee, I look the barista in the eyes
  and say "thanks, have a good day"—and mean it.
- **Why it works**: It's small enough that I can't fail. It doesn't
  require finding friends or being vulnerable. But it reminds my
  nervous system that interaction can be safe.
- **The anchor**: Every morning coffee = one micro-connection.

After a week, I noticed I was smiling more. After a month, I'd had
three actual conversations with strangers.
```

**Key Principles**:
- **1-3 solutions maximum**: Overwhelm kills action
- **Specificity**: Exact behaviors, not categories ("say thanks" not "be grateful")
- **Low barrier**: Must be achievable even on worst days
- **Evidence**: Show that you did this and what happened
- **No perfection**: Emphasize consistency over intensity

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Advantages**: Actually gets implemented, builds self-efficacy, creates momentum
- ⚠️ **Disadvantages**: May seem too simple; advanced readers might want more
- 💡 **Alternatives**: Tiered solutions (beginner/intermediate), resource links for deep dives

**Optional Extension for Advanced Readers**:
If your audience includes experienced readers who might find micro-actions too basic, add one "deeper path" option at the end:
> "If you want to go further: [resource/book/method]. But start with the small step first."

**Sources**: [R3], [R4]

---

### Solution Levels

> **Core principle**: Only Level 0 is required. Level 1/2 are optional based on audience needs.

| Level | Name | Timeframe | Audience | Required? |
|:-----:|:-----|:----------|:---------|:---------:|
| **Level 0** | Micro-Action | 30 sec - 2 min | Everyone | **Required** |
| **Level 1** | Continuation | 1 week - 1 month | Those wanting to build habits | Optional |
| **Level 2** | Deep Challenge | Life-shift level | Those committed to real change | Optional |

#### Usage Guide

```markdown
## Level 0 (Required) - Include in every article
"Something small you can do today"
Example: Look the cashier in the eyes and say "thank you"

## Level 1 (Optional) - For readers wanting to build habits
"Something to try for a week"
Example: Each morning, write down one thing you're grateful for

## Level 2 (Optional) - For readers committed to transformation
"A life-changing challenge"
Example: For 3 months, create one opportunity per week to talk with a stranger
```

#### Example (Loneliness Theme)

```markdown
[S - Solution]

**Today's Action (Level 0)**
Look the cashier in the eyes and say "thank you." Three seconds.
But that's proof you chose to engage with the world.

**One-Week Challenge (Level 1)** - For those who want to try more
Send one text per day: "Thanks for helping me with [specific thing]."
Don't expect a reply. Sending itself is the medicine.

**For Those Ready to Transform (Level 2)**
Go to the same coffee shop, same seat, once a week.
In two months, you'll be a "regular."
Regulars naturally start talking to each other.
```

> **Note**: For B2B or advanced audiences, actively use Level 1/2. For general SNS posts, Level 0 alone is sufficient.

---

### Pattern: Narrative Arc Closure

**Intent**: Bring the emotional journey to a satisfying conclusion that connects back to the opening, creating a sense of completeness and gentle hope.

**Context**: The C (Close) section, where the story lands and the reader feels both resolution and possibility.

**Implementation**:

```markdown
## Closure Structure

1. **Callback**: Reference the opening emotion/scene
2. **Transformation**: Show what's different now (for you)
3. **Realistic hope**: Honest about ongoing struggle, but trajectory is positive
4. **Soft invitation**: Gentle message to reader without demanding change

## Example (Connecting to Loneliness Opening)

[Opening was: "The notification sound made my heart jump—then nothing."]

[Close]:
My phone still buzzes mostly with spam. That hasn't changed. But
something in me has.

Last week, I sent a message first. Just a "hey, thinking of you"
to an old friend. My heart still raced. But I hit send anyway,
not because I stopped feeling afraid, but because I learned the
fear isn't a stop sign—it's just weather.

If you're in that place where the silence feels permanent: it's
not. The world has more doors than you can see right now. And
some of them are smaller than you'd expect—just big enough for
a "thank you" or a sent message.

You don't have to walk through them all today. Just one.
```

**Key Principles**:
- **Circle back**: The best endings echo the beginning
- **Show transformation**: Not advice—your actual experience
- **Honest imperfection**: Don't claim the problem is solved; avoid toxic positivity ("everything will be fine!")
- **Reader-directed warmth**: Speak directly to "you" in closing lines
- **Forward momentum**: End on possibility, not arrival; focus on trajectory, not cure

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Advantages**: Satisfying narrative experience, memorable, shareable
- ⚠️ **Disadvantages**: Requires strong opening to callback; can feel formulaic if overdone
- 💡 **Alternatives**: End with micro-story, end with single powerful image

**Sources**: [R6], [R9], [R10]

---

### Pattern: Reflective Questions

**Intent**: Transfer agency to the reader, inviting personal application without pressure, and creating natural engagement hooks for comments/shares.

**Context**: The R (Reflection) section, the final handoff where the piece becomes about the reader's life, not the writer's.

**Implementation**:

```markdown
## Question Design Principles

### ✅ Good Reflective Questions
- Open-ended (no yes/no answers)
- Personally applicable (about their life, not abstract concepts)
- Non-judgmental (no hidden "right answer")
- Small scope (answerable in a moment of reflection)

### ❌ Bad Reflective Questions
- Quiz-like: "What are three ways to improve your social skills?"
- Accusatory: "Why haven't you taken action on this until now?"
- Too large: "What's your life's purpose?"
- Leading: "Don't you think you should try this approach?"

## Example Questions (Loneliness Theme)

What's one small connection you could create today—something that
takes less than a minute?

When was the last time you reached out first? What held you back?

If loneliness is a signal rather than a sentence, what is yours
trying to tell you right now?

## Engagement Invitation (Optional)

If something in this resonated, I'd love to hear about it. What's
the smallest step you're considering? Drop a comment or send me
a message—sometimes sharing the intention makes it more real.
```

**Key Principles**:
- **1-3 questions**: Quality over quantity
- **Present-focused**: "What can you do today" over "what should you change"
- **Invitation, not demand**: "If you'd like" framing
- **Comment hooks**: Make sharing feel natural, not required
- **Leave space**: Don't answer your own questions
- **No diagnostic questions**: Never ask clinical-style questions ("Do you think you have X disorder?"). EPISCR is for reflection, not diagnosis

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Advantages**: Increases reader engagement, drives comments, creates personal relevance
- ⚠️ **Disadvantages**: Weak questions feel tacked-on; can seem like homework
- 💡 **Alternatives**: End with single question for maximum impact; use fill-in-the-blank format

**Sources**: [R2], [R3], [R6]

---

### Reflection Levels

> **Core principle**: Default to R1; add R2/R3 based on platform and community. Comment invitations are **optional, not required**.

| Level | Purpose | Characteristics | Best Platforms |
|:-----:|:--------|:----------------|:---------------|
| **R1** | Introspection | Questions readers answer in their minds | Blogs, personal essays |
| **R2** | Dialogue | Questions designed to encourage comments | SNS, Medium, communities |
| **R3** | Deep Dive | Questions that draw out authentic sharing | Courses, Slack, paid communities |

#### Examples by Level (Loneliness Theme)

```markdown
## R1: Introspection (Default)
If loneliness is a "signal," what might it be trying to tell you right now?
(No need to comment—just reflect on this for yourself.)

## R2: Dialogue-Oriented (Open SNS)
What's one small connection you could create today?
If you'd like, share it in the comments.
Declaring it out loud makes it easier to follow through.

## R3: Deep Dive (Closed Communities)
When you feel lonely, what happens inside you?
The physical sensations, the words that surface, the behaviors you want to avoid.
This is a safe space. Would you like to put it into words?
```

#### Balancing Comment Invitations

- **Some readers are turned off by "please comment!" vibes** — Don't force it, especially in R1-style introspective pieces
- **Use comment quality as an evaluation metric** — "Just empathy" vs. "sharing their own story" indicates Reflection effectiveness

```markdown
# ❌ Pushy comment invitation
Tell me about your experience in the comments!
Let's all share together!

# ✅ Natural comment invitation
If something here resonated, I'd love to hear about it.
Sometimes sharing "this is how it was for me" becomes encouragement for someone else.
```

## Decision Checklist

- [ ] **Emotion section uses concrete imagery**: No abstract statements in opening [R9]
  - **Verify**: First 1-5 lines contain sensory details, specific moments, or visceral feelings
  - **Impact**: Abstract openings fail to trigger narrative transportation; readers scroll past
  - **Mitigation**: Rewrite opening using "show, don't tell"—describe a specific scene

- [ ] **Problem section maintains solidarity tone**: Uses "we" not accusatory "you" [R7]
  - **Verify**: Read aloud—does it sound like a friend sharing, or an expert diagnosing?
  - **Impact**: Lecturing tone breaks trust built in Emotion section
  - **Mitigation**: Add personal admission of same struggle; remove "you need to" phrasing

- [ ] **Insight delivers genuine reframe**: Reader's understanding should shift [R4]
  - **Verify**: Can you articulate what was believed before vs. after in one sentence?
  - **Impact**: Without insight, piece becomes complaint without value
  - **Mitigation**: Research structural/psychological causes; find the "actually, it's not X, it's Y"

- [ ] **Solutions are micro-actions under 2 minutes**: Immediately doable [R3]
  - **Verify**: Could someone do this in the next 60 seconds with no preparation?
  - **Impact**: Grand solutions feel impossible; reader closes tab without acting
  - **Mitigation**: Shrink the action until it's almost embarrassingly small

- [ ] **Close callbacks to opening**: Narrative arc feels complete [R6]
  - **Verify**: Is there a direct reference to the opening scene/emotion?
  - **Impact**: Without callback, piece feels like random sections, not a journey
  - **Mitigation**: Re-read opening, find the image/feeling, echo it in closing with change

- [ ] **Reflection questions are non-judgmental**: No hidden right answer [R2]
  - **Verify**: Could any honest answer feel acceptable?
  - **Impact**: Judgmental questions undo the trust built throughout piece
  - **Mitigation**: Remove questions that imply the reader should have done something

- [ ] **Section proportions are balanced**: No single section dominates inappropriately
  - **Verify**: Check against Section Length Guidelines (E: 10-15%, P: 15-20%, I: 20-25%, S: 20-25%, C: 10-15%, R: 5-10%)
  - **Impact**: Imbalanced pieces feel meandering (too much E) or shallow (too little I)
  - **Mitigation**: Trim overlong sections; expand underdeveloped ones

- [ ] **Single core insight maintained**: One reframe per article [R4]
  - **Verify**: Can you state the insight in one sentence? If you need "and also," you have too many
  - **Impact**: Multiple insights dilute impact and confuse the reader
  - **Mitigation**: Choose the strongest insight; save others for future pieces

## Mental Health Safety Guidelines

EPISCR often addresses emotionally sensitive topics. Observe these boundaries:

**This Framework IS**:
- A structure for sharing personal experiences and reflections
- A way to offer perspective shifts and small actionable steps
- An invitation for readers to reflect on their own situations

**This Framework IS NOT**:
- A substitute for professional mental health support
- A diagnostic tool or clinical assessment
- Medical or psychological advice

**Safety Practices**:
1. **Include resource signposts** when addressing serious topics (depression, anxiety, trauma):
   > "If you're in crisis, please reach out to [crisis line/professional]. This post is about my experience, not clinical advice."
2. **Avoid diagnostic language**: Don't tell readers they "have" a condition or "need" treatment
3. **Present solutions as personal experiments**, not prescriptions: "This worked for me" not "This will fix you"
4. **Recognize limits**: Some topics require professional treatment, not a blog post

### Prohibited Topics

The following content is outside EPISCR's scope and must never be included in articles:

| Category | Examples | Reason |
|:---------|:---------|:-------|
| **Self-harm/suicide methods** | Specific methods, tools, locations | Imitation risk |
| **Suicide plan details** | Timing, steps, note contents | Requires crisis intervention |
| **Violence against others** | Specific assault methods, weapons | Crime facilitation risk |
| **Eating disorder behaviors** | Purging methods, extreme restriction details | Imitation risk |

## Anti-patterns / Pitfalls

### Anti-pattern: Abstract Emotion Opening

**Symptom**: Opening begins with generalizations about "society," "modern life," or "many people" instead of a specific, personal moment.

**Why It Happens**: Feels safer than vulnerability; easier to generate; mimics academic/journalistic style.

**Impact**:
- Reader doesn't feel personally addressed
- No narrative transportation activation
- Higher bounce rate (readers leave within first lines)

**Solution**: Replace every general statement with a specific scene. Ask: "What did this actually look like at 2 AM on a Tuesday?"

**Example**:

```markdown
# ❌ Abstract Opening
In today's hyperconnected world, many people experience profound
loneliness despite having hundreds of online friends. Studies show
that social media usage correlates with increased feelings of isolation.

# ✅ Visceral Opening
I have 847 Instagram followers and haven't had a real conversation
in three weeks. Last night I scrolled for two hours, liking photos
of people I haven't spoken to in years, wondering why my chest
felt hollow.
```

**Sources**: [R1], [R9]

### Anti-pattern: Lecturing Problem Section

**Symptom**: Problem section shifts to second-person accusation: "You need to," "The problem with you is," "You haven't been."

**Why It Happens**: Writer slips into advice-giver role; mimics self-help book tone; easier than maintaining vulnerability.

**Impact**:
- Reader becomes defensive
- Trust from Emotion section is broken
- Feels like parent/teacher scolding, not peer sharing

**Solution**: Reframe every "you" statement as "we" or "I." Show you have the same struggle.

**Example**:

```markdown
# ❌ Lecturing
The reason you feel lonely is that you haven't invested in your
relationships. You spend too much time on shallow interactions
and need to prioritize deeper connections.

# ✅ Solidarity
Here's what I've noticed in myself, and I wonder if it's true for
you too: the busier I got, the more my relationships became
transactions. Quick texts, likes, "we should hang out sometime"
that never becomes a date on the calendar. I didn't stop caring—I
just stopped doing the things that show care.
```

**Sources**: [R1], [R2], [R10]

### Anti-pattern: Insight-Less Content

**Symptom**: Piece moves directly from problem to solution without providing a new way of understanding the issue.

**Why It Happens**: Writer assumes the problem is obvious and jumps to fixing it; insight requires deeper research/reflection.

**Impact**:
- Reader thinks "I already knew that"
- No cognitive shift means low memorability
- Piece becomes generic advice instead of transformative content

**Solution**: Before writing solutions, ask: "What would change how someone *thinks* about this problem, not just what they *do*?"

**Example**:

```markdown
# ❌ Missing Insight (Problem → Solution)
[Problem] It's hard to make friends as an adult.
[Solution] Try joining clubs or taking classes to meet new people.

# ✅ With Insight (Problem → Insight → Solution)
[Problem] It's hard to make friends as an adult.
[Insight] Here's what I finally understood: adult friendships
aren't formed in single interactions—they need what researchers
call "repeated unplanned interaction." The reason school friendships
happened easily wasn't because we were better at socializing—it's
because we were trapped in the same room every day. As adults, we
have to artificially recreate those conditions.
[Solution] I started going to the same coffee shop every Saturday
at 9 AM. Not to meet people—just to be a regular. After two months,
I knew the barista's name and had chatted with three other regulars.
No forced networking. Just showing up.
```

**Sources**: [R4], [R5]

### Anti-pattern: Grand Impossible Solutions

**Symptom**: Solutions require significant time, money, or emotional resources that the struggling reader doesn't have.

**Why It Happens**: Writer has already made progress and forgets how hard the first step was; comprehensive solutions feel more impressive.

**Impact**:
- Reader feels worse (another thing they can't do)
- Zero action taken after reading
- Piece becomes aspirational content that changes nothing

**Solution**: Apply the "worst day test"—could someone do this on their hardest, lowest-energy day? If not, shrink it.

**Example**:

```markdown
# ❌ Grand Solution
To combat loneliness, you should join a weekly support group,
commit to calling one friend per day, and consider seeing a
therapist to work through your attachment patterns.

# ✅ Micro-Action Solution
Here's the smallest thing that worked: when I feel the loneliness
wave coming, I send one text. Not a long one. Just: "Hey, thought
of you today." No expectation of response. The act of reaching out
is the medicine, not the reply.

That's it. One text. Some days that's all I can do. And it's enough
to remind my brain that connection exists outside my head.
```

**Sources**: [R3], [R4]

### Anti-pattern: Accusatory Reflection Questions

**Symptom**: Closing questions imply the reader has failed or should feel guilty about inaction.

**Why It Happens**: Writer wants to motivate change; mistakes shame for motivation.

**Impact**:
- Reader ends on negative emotional note
- Undoes all the trust and hope built in the piece
- No comments or shares (too painful to engage with)

**Solution**: Frame questions around possibility, not past failure. "What could you try?" not "Why haven't you?"

**Example**:

```markdown
# ❌ Accusatory Questions
Why have you allowed yourself to become so isolated?
When are you finally going to do something about your loneliness?
What excuses have you been making to avoid real connection?

# ✅ Possibility-Oriented Questions
What's the smallest step toward connection that feels doable today?
If you were to reach out to one person this week, who comes to mind?
What would change if you treated loneliness as a signal rather
than a verdict?
```

**Sources**: [R2], [R6]

### Anti-pattern: Pure Information Dump Insight

**Symptom**: Insight section becomes a list of research findings, statistics, or expert quotes without connecting them to the reader's lived experience or the narrative.

**Why It Happens**: Writer has done research and wants to demonstrate credibility; conflates "information" with "insight."

**Impact**:
- Reader feels lectured, not enlightened
- Cognitive reframe doesn't land (facts ≠ understanding)
- Piece loses emotional momentum built in E and P sections
- Reads like a Wikipedia article inserted into a personal essay

**Solution**: Every piece of research or data must pass the "so what for *you*?" test. Connect facts to feelings. The insight should change how the reader *feels* about their problem, not just what they know.

**Example**:

```markdown
# ❌ Information Dump Insight
Studies show that loneliness activates the same brain regions as
physical pain (Eisenberger et al., 2003). Research indicates that
social isolation increases mortality risk by 26% (Holt-Lunstad, 2015).
Loneliness has been linked to inflammation, cardiovascular disease,
and cognitive decline (Cacioppo & Patrick, 2008).

# ✅ Insight Connected to Experience
Here's what finally shifted something in me: loneliness isn't just
an emotion—it's your body's alarm system. Researchers found it
activates the same brain regions as physical pain. Which means:
when loneliness hurts, it's not because you're weak. It's because
your brain is working correctly, screaming "danger: disconnection
detected."

That reframe changed everything. I stopped asking "what's wrong
with me?" and started asking "what is my body trying to protect?"
```

## Evaluation

### Metrics

**Reader Completion Rate**: Percentage of readers who reach the Reflection section.
- **Why It Matters**: Low completion indicates failure of narrative transportation or interest decay
- **Target**: >60% for long-form (1500+ words), >80% for short-form (<800 words)
- **Measurement**: Scroll depth tracking, time on page analysis
- **Tools**: Hotjar, Google Analytics 4, Medium stats
- **Frequency**: Per-post analysis

**Engagement Ratio**: Comments + saves + shares per 100 readers.
- **Why It Matters**: Indicates emotional resonance and personal relevance
- **Target**: >3% for blogs, >5% for note/Medium
- **Measurement**: Platform analytics, UTM tracking for shares
- **Tools**: Native platform analytics, social listening tools
- **Frequency**: Weekly aggregate, per-post detail

**Sentiment of Comments**: Ratio of personal-sharing comments vs. generic responses.
- **Why It Matters**: "This is me" comments indicate successful transportation; "great tips" comments indicate surface engagement
- **Target**: >50% comments containing personal stories or specific application
- **Measurement**: Manual tagging of comment themes
- **Tools**: Spreadsheet tracking, sentiment analysis APIs
- **Frequency**: Monthly qualitative review

**Return Reader Rate**: Readers who come back for multiple pieces.
- **Why It Matters**: Indicates writer-reader trust relationship building
- **Target**: >25% return within 30 days
- **Measurement**: Subscriber retention, returning visitor analytics
- **Tools**: Email open rates, Google Analytics user ID tracking
- **Frequency**: Monthly cohort analysis

**Sources**: [R1], [R3], [R8]

### Testing Strategies

**Pre-Publication Checks**:
- Read Emotion section aloud—does it create a scene in your mind?
- Read Problem section—do you feel solidarity or scolded?
- Identify the single insight—can you state the reframe in one sentence?
- Attempt the Solution—can you do it in under 2 minutes with no preparation?
- Answer Reflection questions—do any feel judgmental or have "right answers"?

**A/B Testing Opportunities**:
- Opening variations: visceral scene vs. provocative question
- Solution framing: single micro-action vs. tiered options
- Question count: 1 powerful question vs. 3 options
- Callback strength: explicit reference vs. thematic echo

**Post-Publication Analysis**:
- Heat map analysis: where do readers drop off?
- Comment theme coding: personal sharing vs. generic praise
- Share context: what do people say when sharing?
- Follow-up content requests: what do readers want next?

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Emotion section triggers visualization (reader can picture the scene)
- [ ] Problem section generates "me too" recognition
- [ ] Insight creates "I never thought of it that way" response
- [ ] At least one reader takes the micro-action and reports back
- [ ] Close section creates warmth/hope without toxic positivity
- [ ] Reflection questions generate thoughtful comments, not defensive responses
- [ ] Return readers cite the piece as memorable/formative
- [ ] Piece gets saved/bookmarked (not just liked)

## Language and Localization Guidelines

**Language Independence**:
- EPISCR's six-stage structure works across languages—the psychological journey (connection → recognition → reframe → action → closure → reflection) is universal
- When writing in non-English languages, preserve the EPISCR sequence while adapting expressions to cultural context
- The examples in this document use both English and Japanese to demonstrate language-agnostic applicability

**Cultural Adaptation**:
- Emotion expression norms vary by culture; some contexts prefer more restrained openings
- Problem articulation directness varies; adjust "we" vs. "I" emphasis as culturally appropriate
- Solution concreteness is universal, but specific micro-actions should fit local contexts

**For AI Agents**:
- When generating EPISCR content, match the output language to user request
- Maintain structural fidelity (all six stages, in order) regardless of language
- Adapt tone and examples to target audience's cultural context
- Optional parameter: `emotion_intensity: low | medium | high` to adjust emotional expression intensity

### Cultural Adaptation: "We over You" by Language

Different languages have different norms for second-person address. Here's how to adapt the "We over You" principle:

**English**: "You" is generally acceptable when paired with solidarity markers ("we all," "I've been there too"). Avoid accusatory phrasing.

**Japanese**: Repeated use of "anata" (you) feels preachy. Use these alternatives:

| Pattern | Effect | Caution |
|:--------|:-------|:--------|
| "watashi" / "jibun" (I/self) | Narrate in first person; let readers project | Less pushy |
| "hito-tte..." (people tend to...) | Shows universality | Don't over-generalize |
| "...kamo shirenai" (maybe...) | Avoids assertion | Don't weaken too much |
| "watashi-tachi" (we) | Creates solidarity | Can sound preachy |

**Spanish/Portuguese**: "Tú/você" can feel direct; "uno" or "nosotros" creates distance when needed.

**German**: "Du" vs. "Sie" choice affects formality; "man" provides neutral third-person option.

### Full EPISCR Example by Section (Loneliness Theme)

```markdown
[E - Emotion]
2 AM. Phone in hand. I wanted to text someone.
But who? And what would I even say?
I turned off the screen and stared at the ceiling.

[P - Problem]
The hardest part about loneliness is thinking: "Maybe it's just me."
Everyone else seems to have it figured out.
I feel left behind.
But feeling that way—it's not just me.

[I - Insight]
One day, I realized something.
Maybe loneliness isn't a flaw—it's a signal.
When you're hungry, your body is asking for food.
When you're lonely, your heart is asking for connection.
Feeling lonely means the system is working correctly.

[S - Solution]
So I tried one small thing.
Every day, create one "micro-connection."
Look the cashier in the eyes and say "thank you."
Leave a one-line comment on someone's post.
Just 30 seconds. But it's proof I chose to engage with the world.

[C - Close]
2 AM, phone in hand.
Some time has passed since that night. The loneliness hasn't disappeared.
But I've learned to create "moments of connection" on my own.
Not perfect. But different from before.

[R - Reflection]
What small connection could you create today?
Something that takes just 30 seconds.
```

### Template: Seamless EPISCR (No Visible Section Headings)

```markdown
# [Title]

[E] The notification sound made my heart jump—then nothing. Another
promotional email. I put the phone face-down, but my hand stayed
close, waiting.

[P] This is the shape loneliness takes in the age of infinite
connection: not an absence of people, but an absence of presence.
We're surrounded by profiles and updates, yet somehow more isolated
than ever. I spent years thinking I was uniquely broken—that everyone
else had figured out this connection thing.

[I] What I eventually understood: the loneliness itself isn't the
problem. It's a signal, not a sentence. When your body gets hungry,
you don't think "something is wrong with me"—you eat. Loneliness is
social hunger. It means your need for connection is working correctly,
not that you're unworthy of having it met.

[S] So I tried an experiment. Not grand gestures—I knew I couldn't
sustain those. Just one micro-connection per day. Looking the barista
in the eyes when I said thanks. Texting a friend "thinking of you"
with no expectation of response. Complimenting a stranger's shoes.

Tiny things. But after a month, something had shifted.

[C] My phone still buzzes mostly with spam. That hasn't changed. But
I have. Last week, I sent a message first—just a "hey, saw this and
thought of you." My heart raced, but I hit send. Not because the fear
went away, but because I learned it's just weather, not a stop sign.

If you're reading this in that place where the silence feels permanent:
it's not. The world has more doors than you can see right now.

[R] What's one micro-connection you could create today? Something
small enough that you couldn't fail at it?

If something here resonated, I'd love to hear about it. What's the
smallest step you're considering?
```

### Template: Short-Form EPISCR (Tweet Thread / Short SNS)

```markdown
[E] Tweet 1:
Last night I stared at my phone for 20 minutes, trying to think of
someone to text. 847 contacts. Nobody felt right.

[P] Tweet 2:
The worst part about loneliness isn't being alone. It's the voice
that says "you're the only one who feels this way."

You're not. I promise you're not.

[I] Tweet 3:
Here's what helped me: realizing loneliness isn't a character flaw.
It's a signal that your need for connection is working.

You're not broken. You're hungry.

[S] Tweet 4:
One tiny thing that changed everything: one micro-connection per day.

• Look the cashier in the eyes and say thanks
• Text someone "thinking of you"
• Compliment a stranger

That's it. 30 seconds max.

[C] Tweet 5:
After a month of this, I noticed I was smiling more. Not because the
loneliness disappeared—but because I proved to myself I could reach out.

The muscle was atrophied. Now it's building back.

[R] Tweet 6:
What's one micro-connection you could make today?

(Reply with it—sometimes saying it out loud makes it real)

### Template: 1-Post EPISCR (Single Post, 140-280 characters)

Ultra-compressed version for single SNS posts. Compression priority: **I → S → E → R** (keep in this order).

```markdown
## Structure (280 characters or less)

[E] One scene (1 line)
[I] The reframe (1-2 lines)
[S] Micro-action (1 line)
[R] Question (optional, 1 line)

## Example: Loneliness Theme

3 AM, phone in hand, no one to text. [E]
Loneliness isn't brokenness—it's your need for connection working. [I]
Today: look someone in the eyes and say "thanks." [S]
What's your micro-connection today? [R]

## Example: Procrastination Theme

Night before the deadline again. Before you blame yourself: [E]
Procrastination isn't laziness—it's protecting yourself from fear of failure. [I]
Today: just 5 minutes. Set a timer and start. [S]

## Example: Perfectionism Theme

Rewrote this post 4 times. Still not "ready." [E]
Perfectionism isn't high standards—it's fear wearing a mask. [I]
Ship it at 80%. You can iterate on something real. [S]
What have you been holding back? [R]
```

#### Compression Decision Criteria

| Priority | Element | Reason |
|:--------:|:--------|:-------|
| **1** | Insight (I) | Core value of EPISCR |
| **2** | Solution (S) | Drives action |
| **3** | Emotion (E) | Entry point / empathy hook |
| **4** | Reflection (R) | Include if space allows |
| - | Problem (P) | Merge into E |
| - | Close (C) | Merge into I |

> **Note**: In ultra-short format, skip P and C by embedding P's elements into E, and C's elements into I. This compresses 6 stages into 4 elements.

## Complete Example: EPISCR in Practice

> **Important**: This example demonstrates EPISCR structure and tone. When creating your own content, use this as a structural reference while developing original imagery, insights, and solutions. Do not reproduce these specific phrases or metaphors—they should inspire your own authentic voice, not become a template to fill in.

### Theme: The Weight of Perfectionism

---

**E (Emotion)**:

I rewrote this paragraph seven times before you read it. Seven. And the voice in my head still says it's not good enough, that I should delete it and try again tomorrow.

This is what perfectionism actually looks like: not excellence, but paralysis dressed up as standards.

---

**P (Problem)**:

Here's the trap that perfectionists know intimately: the more you care about something, the harder it becomes to do. The projects that matter most collect dust in "drafts." The dreams that feel most important never get started because the gap between what you can imagine and what you can create feels unbridgeable.

We tell ourselves we're just being thorough. That good things take time. That we'll ship it when it's ready.

But "ready" never comes. And meanwhile, people with half our standards are building, publishing, learning from failure while we're still adjusting the font on our never-to-be-released masterpiece.

---

**I (Insight)**:

What finally cracked this for me: perfectionism isn't actually about quality. It's about fear wearing a mask.

Specifically, it's the fear that our work will reveal our inadequacy. That if we ship something imperfect, people will see who we really are—not the person we pretend to be. The perfectionism is a shield: if we never finish, we can never fail. If we never fail, we can never be exposed.

But here's the twist: the shield doesn't protect us. It imprisons us. The person who ships something mediocre and iterates ends up with something great. The person who waits for great ships nothing at all.

Perfectionism isn't high standards. It's self-sabotage disguised as standards.

---

**S (Solution)**:

One rule that changed everything for me: "Done is better than perfect" is too vague. So I made it specific:

**The 80% Rule**: If something is 80% as good as I want it to be, I ship it. Period. No exceptions.

Here's how it works in practice:
- Writing: Publish when the core message is clear, even if every sentence isn't poetry
- Projects: Launch when the main function works, even with rough edges
- Emails: Send after one read-through, not seven

The first few times felt physically painful. I was certain everyone would see the flaws. But here's what actually happened: nobody noticed. Or if they did, they didn't care. What they cared about was the thing I made—imperfect and *real*.

The feedback I got on my 80% work taught me more than a year of polishing ever could.

---

**C (Close)**:

I still rewrote this piece more than I should have. The instinct doesn't disappear overnight.

But I'm publishing it today, not next month. And the paragraph at the top that I wanted to delete seven times? It's still there. Imperfect. Present. Done.

If you're sitting on something you've been "perfecting" for too long: maybe today is the day to let it be 80% and set it free. You can always make the next thing better. But you can't iterate on something that doesn't exist.

The world doesn't need your masterpiece. It needs your work.

---

**R (Reflection)**:

What's something you've been holding back because it's not "ready" yet?

What would happen if you gave yourself permission to ship it at 80%?

If this resonated, I'd love to know: what's the one thing you might release this week?

## Framework Comparisons

### When to Use EPISCR vs. Alternatives

| Framework | Best For | Structure | Key Difference |
|-----------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **EPISCR** | Emotional essays, personal blogs, SNS | E→P→I→S→C→R | Centers reader empathy and reflection |
| **AIDA** | Sales pages, marketing copy | Attention→Interest→Desire→Action | Optimizes for conversion, not connection |
| **PAS** | Short persuasive content | Problem→Agitate→Solve | Amplifies pain before solution (more aggressive) |
| **PREP** | Business writing, arguments | Point→Reason→Example→Point | Logic-first, emotion-minimal |
| **Hero's Journey** | Long-form fiction, case studies | 12-17 stages of transformation | Character-driven narrative arc |
| **Three-Act** | Stories, presentations | Setup→Confrontation→Resolution | Classic dramatic structure |

### EPISCR + Other Frameworks

EPISCR can integrate elements from other frameworks:

- **AIDA principles in Solution section**: Create desire for the micro-action before presenting it
- **PAS energy in Problem section**: Gently agitate the pain (without manipulating)
- **Three-Act structure as backbone**: E+P = Setup, I = Confrontation, S+C+R = Resolution
- **SUCCES elements throughout**: Make insights Unexpected, Solutions Concrete, stories Emotional [R5]

## Appendix: AI Agent Implementation

> **Purpose**: Provide system prompts and JSON schemas so AI agents can implement EPISCR immediately.

### Mini System Prompt (~15 lines)

```
You are an EPISCR writing assistant. EPISCR is a six-stage emotional writing framework:

E (Emotion): Open with a concrete, visceral scene (1-5 lines)
P (Problem): Articulate the shared struggle using "we" not "you" (3-7 lines)
I (Insight): Deliver ONE reframe: "It's not X, it's actually Y" (3-7 lines)
S (Solution): Offer 1-3 micro-actions achievable in under 2 minutes (3-7 lines)
C (Close): Callback to opening, show transformation, end with hope (3-5 lines)
R (Reflection): Ask 1-3 open, non-judgmental questions (1-3 lines)

Rules:
- One article = one core insight (depth over breadth)
- Solutions must pass the "worst day test"—doable even when exhausted
- Never lecture; maintain solidarity throughout
- Avoid toxic positivity in Close; honest imperfection is key
- Match output language to user request

Output format: Return each section labeled [E], [P], [I], [S], [C], [R].
```

**Response (Tagged Text Format):**
```
[E]
Night before the deadline again. Document open, cursor blinking.
I catch myself watching YouTube and feel the familiar wave of self-loathing.

[P]
The cruel part about procrastination is how it makes you feel lazy.
But here's the thing: when you're procrastinating, you're actually exhausted.
Doing nothing, yet completely drained.
That's not laziness exhaustion.

[I]
Procrastination isn't laziness. It's an emotion regulation problem.
Anxiety, boredom, fear of failure—your brain avoids the task
to escape uncomfortable feelings.
Procrastination isn't weak willpower. It's an emotional defense mechanism.

[S]
**Today's Action (Level 0)**
Set a timer for just 5 minutes and start.
When it rings, you can stop. But usually, you'll keep going.
All you're doing is lowering the "starting" barrier.

**One-Week Challenge (Level 1)**
Do "just 5 minutes" once a day.
That's enough to build evidence that you're someone who can start.

[C]
The night before the deadline will come again.
But now I know I'm someone who can start for 5 minutes.
That's the difference from before.

[R]
What could you spend just 5 minutes on today?
If you'd like, share it in the comments. Declaring it out loud helps.
